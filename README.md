# Paper

Small targets are one of the main reasons that affect the performance of target detection algorithms. In this paper, I propose an improved object detection model based on YOLOv5. First, I designed the GnConv-Sem module to increase the receptive field of the model, then I developed the MCSF multi-channel self-supervised feature extraction module to extract feature information, and finally, I used the swim-transformer module to build a simpler and more efficient algorithm head. The results show that the mean average precision (mAP) of the improved model in remote sensing images is 96.9%, which is 3.6% higher than the model before the improvement. The results show that the improved method I propose can effectively improve the performance of the model and has good detection performance for small objects in remote sensing images.
